Advanced-Virtual-Digest
=======================

A GAE web app for virtual restriction digests, pulls vector and enzyme information from addgene, includes ability to store sequences and autocomplete for vectors and enzymes

This is still a work in progress, and the code is messy. I made this in a rush to help with lab work, I promise to clean it up soon!

Current features:

*Favorite Sequence Storage
*Autofill form fields for vectors and restriction enzymes
*Sequence scraper for all addgene backbone sequences and restriction enzymes
*Ability to do custom digests, map all restriction sites, remove an insert without cutting within it and linearizing sequences.
*Able to insert DNA sequences into vectors given insert sites

To be done:
*Unit tests
*Cron job to update vector database
*A better interface
*Vector map creation
*Agarose gel predictor
*Offload cutting to backends in order to improve efficiency
